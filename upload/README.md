# UPLOAD Directory

The `upload` directory itself should be considered the root of your Watchy system. Do not push `upload` onto your Watchy, push the files/folders INSIDE `upload` to your Watchy.

The files contained in this folder live on the root of Watchy, they are ran at boot time.  `boot.py` is executed first, `main.py` is executed second.
